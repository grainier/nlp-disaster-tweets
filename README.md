# nlp-disaster-tweets
In this project, I tackle the Kaggle competition "Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets." The challenge is to build a model that can predict whether a given tweet is about a real disaster (target = 1) or not (target = 0). This task is essential in real-world applications for quickly identifying urgent information during disasters.
