# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

In this project, I tackle the Kaggle competition "Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets." The challenge is to build a model that can predict whether a given tweet is about a real disaster (target = 1) or not (target = 0). This task is essential in real-world applications for quickly identifying urgent information during disasters.

The Kaggle notebook for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/grainier/natural-language-processing-with-disaster-tweets/notebook).
